<p><strong>Diana Mateus</strong> - <em>Prognosis Prediction of Myeloma Patients with Random
Survival Forests.</em><br>
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a bone marrow cancer that accounts for 10\% of
all hematological malignancies. FDG PET Quantitative imaging has great
importance for its treatment protocol guidance. In this study, we aim to
develop a computer-assisted method based on PET imaging features towards
assisting personalized diagnosis and treatment decisions for MM
patients. We consider texture-based (radiomics) features on top of
conventional (e.g. SUVmax) and clinical biomarkers, resulting in a large
input/feature vector. Our proposed model relies on a two-stage Random
Survival Forest (RFS) for both feature selection and prediction. The
targeted variable for prediction is the progression-free survival(PFS),
that is, the period of time until the first progression or relapse. We
demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach in terms of C-index
and final prognosis separation on a database of 66 patients who were
part of the prospective multi-centric french IMAJEM study. Our results
confirm the predictive value of radiomics for MM patients. Indeed,
quantitative/heterogeneity image-based features reduce the error of the
predicted progression.</p>
<p><strong>Celia Biane</strong> - <em>Different approaches for the identification of
perturbations in Boolean networks.</em> Boolean networks are discrete
dynamical systems that are increasingly used in the field of systems
biology to understand how complex cellular behaviors (phenotypes) emerge
from the interaction of their molecular components. In this context, the
interacting elements of the network represent diverse molecules whose
local Boolean state is influenced by the state of other elements of the
network, and the asymptotic states of the network represent the
phenotype. During the last few years, different modelling and
algorithmic approaches have been proposed for the identification of sets
of local perturbations leading to a goal asymptotic behavior. During
this presentation, I will propose different criteria of comparison of
these approaches, show their application on a published model of bladder
cancer and discuss their interpretation in the context of
personalized/precision medicine.</p>
<p><strong>Benno Schwikowski</strong> - <em>Interpretable machine learning to discover and
map physiological activity using omics data.</em><br>
The activation or deactivation of most physiological processes in health
and disease can be expected to be reflected in coordinated changes at
the molecular level. The discovery and mapping of physiological
processes from transcriptomic data can thus be attempted, for example,
using models that are based on the quantification of single RNAs, or
linear combinations thereof. The underlying biology reality is often
likely to be more complex than this, but limited data availability and
limited computational resources make it difficult to go beyond these
simple models while preserving statistical power and interpretability of
the results.<br>
In my talk, I will discuss two instances of new and carefully calibrated
data analysis approaches that allowed us to discover and validate
previously unknown associations between transcriptomic data and
biomedically relevant physiology. Both models are highly interpretable
and generic enough to be applied to a wide range omics analysis
scenarios.<br>

<p><strong>Loic Paulevé</strong> - <em>Most Permissive Boolean Networks: Application to
Inference of Models of Cellular Differentiation</em><br>
Boolean networks are a commonly used framework to model dynamics of
large-scale interaction networks. They aim at enabling to reason on
temporal behaviours of networks without requiring precise knowledge on
kinetics and interaction thresholds.<br>
However, their usual interpretation can lead to wrong conclusions on
their capability to reach certain behaviours. More precisely, refining a
Boolean network model (with multivalued or ODEs for instance) can
restrict some behaviours, but also create new ones, which are not
predicted at the Boolean level.<br>
This is problematic when inferring networks at the Boolean level, as it
leads to reject actually valid models, hence introducing bias in the
analysis of candidate models of cellular processes.<br>
We introduce a new interpretation of Boolean networks which fixes this
issue: with Most Permissive Boolean Networks, it is guaranteed that
model refinements only restrict the capabilities of the model, thus
allowing a correct abstract reasoning.<br>
Moreover, Most Permissive Boolean Networks are also much more tractable
to analyse and do not suffer from the state space explosion.<br>
We illustrate their application to a scalable inference of models of
cellular differentiation, which involve thorough constraints on the
global dynamics of the network.</p>
<p><strong>Dimitri Meistermann</strong> - <em>The limit of cell specification concept: a
lesson from scRNA-Seq on early human development.</em> (joint work with
Sophie Loubersac, Arnaud Reignier, Valentin Francois-Campion, Thomas
Fréour, Jérémie Bourdon and Laurent David)<br>
Recent technological advances such as single-cell RNAseq have allowed an
unprecedented access into processes orchestrating human preimplantation
development [1, 2]. However, the sequence of events which occur during
human preimplantation development are still unknown. In particular,
timing of the very first human lineage specification remains elusive.
During this event, the morula cells are can acquire two fates: the
trophectoderm that will give rise the placenta and inner cell mass that
will give rise the fetus. We present a human preimplantation development
model based on transcriptomic pseudotime modelling of four scRNAseq
dataset, biologically validated by spatial information and precise
time-lapse staging. In contrast to mouse [3], we show that
trophectoderm / inner cell mass lineage specification in human is only
detectable at the transcriptomic level at the blastocyst stage, just
prior to expansion. By studying this delay, we show that cellular
specification is a time window that begins with the establishment of
cellular junctions, which polarize the embryo. These are the first
factors that discriminates the two cell fates. The cell specification
ends with the divergence of transcriptome profiles. For identifying the
precise timings of this divergence, we have coupled the pseudotime
modelling from Monocle2 [4] with several other tools. First, we
performed an estimation of RNA velocity with velocyto [5]. This tool
can retrieve the genes that are going to be down or upregulated in each
cell, by processing the intron data that are contained into scRNAseq
reads. We used WGCNA [6] for describing the waves of genes that paces
human preimplantation development. By combining these tools, we found
novel markers, validated by immunofluorescences. Their expression
profile enables a precise staging of human preimplantation embryos, such
as IFI16 which highlights establishment of epiblast and NR2F2 which
appears at the transition from specified to mature trophectoderm.
Strikingly, mature trophectoderm cells arise from the polar side, just
after specification, supporting a model of polar trophectoderm cells
driving trophectoderm maturation. Altogether, our study unravels the
first lineage specification event in the human embryo and provides a
browsable resource, based on d3.js, for mapping spatio-temporal events
underlying human lineage specification.<br>

<p><strong>Maxime Folschette</strong> - <em>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most
widespread and lethal type of liver cancer today. Understanding the
causes of its proliferation is thus a major challenge.</em><br>
In this work, we extract new biological regarding HCC proliferation
based on a signaling network and partial observations of its components.
Our network is extracted from Kegg, although Pathway Commons and other
databases are also candidates. The observations come from a differential
analysis of gene expression between invasive and non-invasive tumor
tissues. Based on this initial data, we run a prediction algorithm
called Iggy which extracts new knowledge when the observations are
sufficient. The results illustrate the statistical precision of our
computational predictions and exposes new knowledge concerning the
activity of three protein-complexes (NFKB1::BCL3, NFKB2::RELB and
JUND::NACA) which are validated through functional analyses and
literature review on HCC.</p>

Thieffry</strong> - <em>Cooperation between T cell receptor and Toll-like receptor
5 signaling for CD4+ T cell activation</em><br>
CD4+ T cells recognize antigens through their T cell receptors. However,
additional signals involving co-stimulatory receptors, for example CD28,
are required for proper T cell activation. Alternative co-stimulatory
receptors have been proposed, including members of the Toll-like
receptor family, such as TLR5 and TLR2. However, the molecular mechanism
underlying this co-stimulatory function has not yet been fully
elucidated.<br>
Here, we report the generation of detailed molecular maps and logical
models for the T cell receptor (TCR) and Toll-like receptor (TLR5)
signalling pathways, along with a merged model accounting for
cross-interactions. Furthermore, we validated the resulting model by
analysing the responses of T cells to the activation of these pathways
alone or in combination, in terms of CREB, AP-1 (c-Jun) and NF-kB (p65)
activation.<br>
Our merged model accurately reproduces the experimental results, showing
that the activation of TLR5 can play a similar role to that of CD28,
regarding AP-1, CREB and NF-кB activation, thereby, providing novel
insights regarding cross-regulations of these pathways in CD4+ T cells.</p>
<p><strong>Samuel Chaffron</strong> - <em>Human gut microbiome co-activity networks in
heath and disease</em><br>
Microbial communities inhabiting our intestinal tract impact and
influence our nutrition, immunity and development. Today,
High-Throughput Sequencing and functional genomics are revealing the
under-explored diversity and complexity of these microbial ecosystems.
Limited by the fact that most microbes can hardly be isolated and
cultivated in lab-controlled environments, we are just starting to grasp
the complexity and diversity of microbial interactions. Even when
successful, laboratory experiments inherently lose valuable information
about the richness and diversity of community functioning and
interactions in situ. Today, large scale environmental surveys of
microbial communities across Earth's ecosystems (e.g. Tara Oceans
expeditions, integrative Human Microbiome Project) gathered large
volumes of meta-omic and contextual data that are enabling the
reconstruction of genomes of uncultivated microbial species or
Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs). While classical co-occurrence
analyses enable to predict interactions between newly identified
microbes, these approaches are inherently limited since true biotic
interactions can hardly be disentangle from abiotic (environmental)
effects. Here, we developed a trait-based approach to enrich
co-occurring information and uncover putative biotic interactions among
human gut MAGs. Genomic and growth traits can directly be inferred from
MAGs and meta-omics data. Here, co-growth signals across individuals are
used to reveal positive and negative putative interactions between
co-occurring microbes. In addition, the functional content of MAGs and
the reconstruction of their metabolism will be used to predict and model
potential microorganismsâ€™ dependencies. Inferring and combining
(meta-)genomic traits in a global approach can help to identify
consortia of microbes and pave the way towards the functional
understanding and the metabolic modeling of their interactions in health
and disease.</p>
<p><strong>Laurence Calzone</strong> - <em>Une méthodologie de personalisation des modèles
Booléens pour tester des inhibiteurs, simples ou doubles, avec des
réponses qui varient selon les profils de patients</em><br>
Logical models of cancer pathways are typically built by mining the
literature for relevant experimental observations or by inquiring
pathway databases. They are usually generic as they apply for large
cohorts of individuals. As a consequence, they generally do not capture
the heterogeneity of patient tumours and their therapeutic responses.
After introducing our approach for constructing logical models and
simulating them stochastically, I will present the methodology for
personalising logical models to data and show how these models can be
used for testing the effect of drugs.</p>
<p><strong>Lokmane Chebouba</strong> -<em>Proteomics measurements combined with constraint
programming for predicting treatment response in Acute Myeloid Leukemia
cancer case</em><br>
The use of data from high-throughput technologies to target drugs has
been widespread in recent decades. Several approaches have been applied
to biomedical data to detect disease-specific proteins and genes to
better target drugs. We propose a new method for discriminating the
response of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) to treatments.
The proposed approach uses proteomic data and the prior knowledge
network to predict the results of cancer treatment by discovering the
different Boolean networks specific to each type of treatment response.<br>
The results are encouraging and demonstrate the benefit of our approach
to distinguish patient groups with different response to treatment. In
particular each treatment response group is characterized by a
predictive model in the form of a signaling Boolean network. This model
describes regulatory mechanisms which are specific to each response
group. This mechanistic and predictive model also allows us to classify
new patients data into the two different patient response groups.</p>
